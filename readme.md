# Eddy/Route

Eddy/Route is an abstraction of [nikic/FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute).

Similarly to [League/Route](https://route.thephpleague.com/), this library aims to provide a friendlier API for [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute), as well as adding a few tweaks.

It is not as feature rich as [League/Route](https://route.thephpleague.com/), but intends to be simple and flexible.
